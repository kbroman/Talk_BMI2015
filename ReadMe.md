### Talk on &ldquo;Interactive graphics for genetic data&rdquo;

These are slides for a talk that I gave in the
[Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu)
at the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison on 16 October 2015, and at
the
[Division of Biostatistics](https://www.uthsc.edu/prevmed/biostats.php),
[University of Tennessee Health Science Center](https://www.uthsc.edu)
